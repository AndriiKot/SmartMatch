Title: "Sunshine"

(Verse 1)
You light up the darkest night,
In your arms, everything feels right,
With every heartbeat, we're alive,
In your warmth, I can thrive.

(Chorus)
Oh, sunshine, youâ€™re my light,
Guiding me through the night,
Together we will shine so bright,
Our love will never lose its sight.
