"Whispers of the Wind"

(Verse 1)
In the quiet of the trees,
I can hear the stories, whispers in the breeze,
Nature speaks in a gentle sigh,
Calling us to reach for the sky.

(Chorus)
Whispers of the wind, carry me away,
To where the heart knows how to play,
In the stillness, I will find,
The melody thatâ€™s intertwined.
