Title: "Wings of Freedom"

(Verse 1)
With every step, we rise above,
Breaking barriers that confine,
In the winds, we’ll dance with love,
Embracing life, it’s all divine.

(Chorus)
Wings of freedom, we will soar,
Through the clouds, we’ll touch the sky,
With every heartbeat, we explore,
In this journey, we’ll fly high.
