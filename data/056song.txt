Title: "High Above"

(Verse 1)
In the sky where eagles soar,
We’ll rise above the doubts and fears,
Finding strength in what’s in store,
As we echo through the years.

(Chorus)
We’ll be high above the world’s despair,
Feel the freedom in the air,
In every dream, a whispered prayer,
Together we’ll unfold with care.
