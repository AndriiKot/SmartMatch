Title: "Rise with the Sun"

(Verse 1)
Morning breaks with gentle grace,
Painting skies in shades of gold,
In each dawn, a new embrace,
A chance for stories yet untold.

(Chorus)
We'll rise with the sun, unafraid,
Chasing shadows, breaking free,
In this light, we'll never fade,
Together, you and me.
