Title: "Echoes of the Heart"

(Verse 1)
In the silence, I can hear,
The whispers of my spiritâ€™s song,
Echoes of the love we share,
Together, we will always belong.

(Chorus)
These echoes of the heart remind,
Of every moment intertwined,
With each beat, I feel you near,
In this dance that we hold dear.

(Verse 2)
Through the challenges and strife,
Our love will carry us away,
In the rhythm of this life,
Forever in your arms, I'll stay.

(Chorus)
These echoes of the heart remind,
Of every moment intertwined,
With each beat, I feel you near,
In this dance that we hold dear.
