Title: "Beneath the Waves"

(Verse 1)
Underneath the ocean’s sigh,
Secrets linger, deep and wide,
In the depths, our dreams can fly,
With the tide, we’ll now abide.

(Chorus)
Beneath the waves, we’ll find our peace,
In the currents, we will roam,
Through the currents, we release,
In the blue, we make our home.
