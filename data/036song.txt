Title: "Timeless Journey"

(Verse 1)
In every heartbeat, our story flows,
A timeless journey, where love just grows.
With every tear and every smile,
Together we’ll travel this endless mile.

(Chorus)
It’s a timeless journey, we’ll never part,
With wings of love, we’ll soar and start.
Through every season, we’ll find our way,
In this dance of life, we’ll always stay.
