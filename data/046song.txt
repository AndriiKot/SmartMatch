Title: "Sailing Through Shadows"

(Verse 1)
With the wind upon my face,
I’ll navigate through the unknown,
Through the storm, I’ll find my place,
In every whisper, I have grown.

(Chorus)
I’m sailing through shadows, bold and free,
Finding light where the waters flow,
In this journey, I will see,
All the magic I can know.
