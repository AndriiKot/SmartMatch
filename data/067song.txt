Title: "Color of Hope"

(Verse 1)
In the palette of our lives,
Each stroke sings of who we are,
With every tear that helps us strive,
We paint the world, our guiding star.

(Chorus)
The color of hope will rise and shine,
In hues of love, we’re meant to soar,
With every heartbeat, you are mine,
Together, we’ll forever explore.
