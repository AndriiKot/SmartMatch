Title: "Seasons of Love"

(Verse 1)
Through the winter’s chill and spring’s bloom,
We’ll dance in the fall’s soft embrace,
In every season, joy will loom,
Our love will time and space trace.

(Chorus)
Seasons of love will come and go,
But in our hearts, we’ll hold it tight,
Through every high and every low,
Together, we’ll ignite the night.
