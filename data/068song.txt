Title: "Veil of Dreams"

(Verse 1)
In the fabric of our hopes,
We’ll stitch together tales of old,
Through the dark, we’ll find the ropes,
In this journey, love unfolds.

(Chorus)
Veil of dreams, we’ll lift together,
Revealing truths in every seam,
Through the storm and sunny weather,
We’ll create our perfect dream.
