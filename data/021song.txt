Title: "Holding On"

(Verse 1)
When the world feels cold and grey,
I will wrap you in my arms,
Through the struggles of the day,
Our love will shield us from all harms.

(Chorus)
I’m holding on, through thick and thin,
With every heartbeat, we will win,
Together facing what’s unknown,
In your embrace, I feel at home.

(Verse 2)
When the shadows start to creep,
And doubt begins to rise,
With every promise that we keep,
We’ll find the strength to touch the skies.

(Chorus)
I’m holding on, through thick and thin,
With every heartbeat, we will win,
Together facing what’s unknown,
In your embrace, I feel at home.
