Title: "Stars Align"

(Verse 1)
In the cosmos, our fates collide,
Galaxies twinkling overhead,
With each heartbeat, side by side,
We weave the patterns that we've spread.

(Chorus)
When the stars align tonight,
Magic flows through every vein,
In our hearts, a spark of light,
Guiding us through joy and pain.
