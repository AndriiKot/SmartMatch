Title: "Celestial Embrace"

(Verse 1)
Underneath the starry skies,
We’ll dance among the cosmic floor,
With every twinkle, our love flies,
Opening up a brand-new door.

(Chorus)
In a celestial embrace we’ll be,
Floating through the night so wide,
With a love that’s wild and free,
By each other’s side, we’ll ride.
