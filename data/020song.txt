Title: "Reflections"

(Verse 1)
In the mirror of my heart,
I see echoes of the past,
Moments cherished, never far apart,
A story woven, built to last.

(Chorus)
Reflections of our love remain,
Through laughter, joy, and even pain,
In every glance, I see the truth,
The beauty of our precious youth.

(Verse 2)
As the seasons come and go,
I hold the memories so tight,
In this journey, I will grow,
Forever guided by your light.

(Chorus)
Reflections of our love remain,
Through laughter, joy, and even pain,
In every glance, I see the truth,
The beauty of our precious youth.
