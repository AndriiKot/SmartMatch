Title: "Whispers of the Heart"

(Verse 1)
In the stillness, secrets sigh,
Promises linger in the air,
With every glance, a silent "why,"
In this dance, we share despair.

(Chorus)
Whispers of the heart will lead,
Through the noise, weâ€™ll find our song,
In the silence, plant the seed,
Together, we are strong.
