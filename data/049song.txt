Title: "Through the Mist"

(Verse 1)
Veils of fog wrap around the night,
Veering paths, both dark and light,
But with courage, I will persist,
For there’s treasure through the mist.

(Chorus)
I’ll walk through the mist, hand in hand,
Finding treasures, not just sand,
In the haze, I hear the call,
Embracing the unknown, I’ll stand tall.
