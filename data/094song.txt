Title: "Chasing Fire"

(Verse 1)
In the dusk, where shadows meet,
We’ll awaken all the flames,
Daring hearts, no trace of defeat,
In this dance, we’ll stake our claims.

(Chorus)
We’re chasing fire through the night,
Igniting dreams, we’re truly alive,
With passion, we’ll embrace the light,
In the heat, forever thrive.
