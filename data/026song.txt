Title: "Flicker of Hope"

(Verse 1)
In the shadows, a flicker shines,
A beacon of light, where love entwines.
Through the trials, I see it clear,
A glimmer of hope, dispelling fear.

(Chorus)
Iâ€™ll hold on to this flicker of hope,
With every heartbeat, I learn to cope.
In the darkest moments, I will find,
A strength within, so intertwined.
