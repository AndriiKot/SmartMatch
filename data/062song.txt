Title: "Journey to Tomorrow"

(Verse 1)
With every heartbeat, we will pave,
A path that leads into the light,
Through the shadows, strong and brave,
In our souls, we’ll find the might.

(Chorus)
Journey to tomorrow, hand in hand,
In the beauty of the unknown,
With every step, we’ll take a stand,
Together, we will find our home.
