Title: "A Path of Stars"

(Verse 1)
Footsteps tracing in the sand,
Side by side as day turns night,
With dreams before us, hand in hand,
In the stars, we’ll find our light.

(Chorus)
On this path of stars we tread,
Every moment we embrace,
In the love words left unsaid,
We’ll find our sanctuary, our place.
