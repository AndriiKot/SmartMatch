Title: "Dancing Shadows"

(Verse 1)
In the twilight, we come alive,
Movements flowing with the breeze,
With every step, our spirits thrive,
In this moment, hearts find ease.

(Chorus)
Dancing shadows in the night,
Spinning dreams like stardust fair,
With every beat, weâ€™ll take flight,
Lost together in the air.
