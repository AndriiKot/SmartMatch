Title: "Fragments of Light"

(Verse 1)
In the chaos of the day,
Moments shine like shards of glass,
Together, we will pave the way,
In our hearts, this love will last.

(Chorus)
Fragments of light, we’ll gather near,
Creating beauty from the pain,
With every smile, we banish fear,
In this bond, there’s so much gain.
