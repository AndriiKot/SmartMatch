Title: "Fields of Gold"

(Verse 1)
In the meadows where the wildflowers bloom,
We’ll chase the echoes of our laughter,
With every step, dispelling gloom,
Creating memories that linger after.

(Chorus)
In these fields of gold, we sway,
Basking in the sunlit glow,
Through every challenge, come what may,
We’ll find our strength and let it show.
