Title: "Rise Again"

(Verse 1)
When the road is tough and weary,
And my feet feel worn and gray,
I find a spark, though it’s dreary,
To light the path, I’ll find my way.

(Chorus)
I will rise again, I’ll stand my ground,
Through the fire, I’ll be strong,
With every heartbeat, hear the sound,
Of my spirit, pure and long.

(Verse 2)
Mountains high may block my view,
But I’ll climb with all my might,
For in my heart, I know it’s true,
There’s a victory in sight.

(Chorus)
I will rise again, I’ll stand my ground,
Through the fire, I’ll be strong,
With every heartbeat, hear the sound,
Of my spirit, pure and long.
