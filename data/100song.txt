Title: "Mirrors of the Soul"

(Verse 1)
In reflections, we find our truth,
Hidden depths of what we feel,
Every heartbeat, a piece of proof,
In this moment, we reveal.

(Chorus)
Mirrors of the soul, shining bright,
Telling tales, both old and new,
In our eyes, the spark of light,
Guiding us to what is true.
