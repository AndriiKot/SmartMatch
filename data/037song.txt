Title: "Veil of Dreams"

(Verse 1)
Underneath the veil where dreams reside,
With whispered hopes, we’ll turn the tide.
In the quiet moments, our spirits soar,
Together we’ll find what we’re longing for.

(Chorus)
Behind the veil of dreams, we’ll seek our truth,
With every step, we’ll reclaim our youth.
In this tapestry of life, we’ll weave our tale,
With love as our compass, we cannot fail.
