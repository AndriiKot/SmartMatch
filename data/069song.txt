Title: "Silent Journeys"

(Verse 1)
In the quiet of the night we roam,
Exploring paths that feel so right,
With every step, we’ll find a home,
In the shadows, we’ll ignite.

(Chorus)
Silent journeys, hearts aligned,
In the stillness, dreams take flight,
With every breath, our souls intertwined,
Together, we’ll find the light.
