Title: "Whispers in the Dark"

(Verse 1)
In the silence where shadows play,
I hear your voice, guiding my way.
Every whisper brings me near,
In the darkest night, I feel you here.

(Chorus)
Whispers in the dark, a love so true,
With each breath, I’ll find my way back to you.
In the depths of night, our souls unite,
Together forever, we’ll take flight.
