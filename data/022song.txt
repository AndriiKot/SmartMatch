Title: "Rise Again"

(Verse 1)
When the darkness clouds the day,
And hope seems lost in the night,
I will find my way to stay,
With courage burning, I’ll ignite.

(Chorus)
I will rise again, no fear inside,
In the fire of my soul, I’ll bide,
With every challenge, I will grow,
Embracing life, I’ll let it flow.

(Verse 2)
Through every trial, I’ll remain,
With strength I never knew I had,
In every heartbeat, I’ll sustain,
The dreams that make my spirit glad.

(Chorus)
I will rise again, no fear inside,
In the fire of my soul, I’ll bide,
With every challenge, I will grow,
Embracing life, I’ll let it flow.
