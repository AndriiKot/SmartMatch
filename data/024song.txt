Title: "Embers Glow"

(Verse 1)
In the quiet dusk, the embers glow,
Whispers of love, in the twilight's flow.
Together we’ve faced the rise and fall,
Through every storm, we’ll conquer all.

(Chorus)
Like embers in the night, we’ll burn so bright,
With the warmth of our hearts, we’ll take flight.
No shadows can dim what we hold dear,
In this dance of life, there’s nothing to fear.
