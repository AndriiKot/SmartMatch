Title: "Through the Flames"

(Verse 1)
Through the flames, we’ll walk with grace,
With every trial, we’ll find our place.
With courage in our hearts, we’ll face the fire,
Together we’ll rise, our spirits higher.

(Chorus)
Through the flames, we’ll stand so strong,
With love as our armor, we can’t go wrong.
In every battle, side by side we’ll stand,
Together forever, hand in hand.
