Title: "Unbroken Chains"

(Verse 1)
Together we’ve faced the trials,
Breaking free from all we know,
In our journey, we span miles,
Finding strength in what we sow.

(Chorus)
With unbroken chains, we’ll rise,
Through every storm, we’ll pave the way,
In our love that never dies,
We’ll stand united, come what may.
