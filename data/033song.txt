Title: "Chasing the Dawn"

(Verse 1)
As the night fades, a new day breaks,
With hopes and dreams, our hearts awake.
Together we’ll rise with the morning light,
Chasing the dawn, we’ll take our flight.

(Chorus)
Chasing the dawn, we’ll seize the day,
With love as our guide, we’ll find our way.
No fear in our hearts, just flame and glow,
Together we’ll shine, wherever we go.
