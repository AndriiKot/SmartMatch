Title: "Chasing Rainbows"

(Verse 1)
After the storm, the colors bloom,
Painting skies with vibrant hues,
In the light, I feel the room,
Filled with hope and endless views.

(Chorus)
I’m chasing rainbows, bright and bold,
Through every tear, the stories told,
With every step, I find my way,
In the beauty of a brand new day.

(Verse 2)
Every moment, a treasure to seek,
In the laughter, in the cries,
I’m stronger now, I will not be weak,
With love that never dies.

(Chorus)
I’m chasing rainbows, bright and bold,
Through every tear, the stories told,
With every step, I find my way,
In the beauty of a brand new day.
