Title: "Embrace the Storm"

(Verse 1)
When the thunder shakes the ground,
And the lightning streaks the sky,
In the chaos, love is found,
In each other, we’ll rely.

(Chorus)
Embrace the storm, we’ll dance in rain,
With courage, we’ll face what’s to come,
In the wild, we’ll break every chain,
Together, we will overcome.
