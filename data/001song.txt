Title: "Chasing Dreams"

(Verse 1)
In the silence of the night,
I hear whispers in the dark,
Guiding me to endless light,
Igniting passion, like a spark.

(Chorus)
I’m chasing dreams, I won’t let go,
Through the storm, through the rain,
With every step, my heart will grow,
Finding joy, embracing pain.

(Verse 2)
Stars above are shining bright,
Leading me on this journey wide,
Every shadow turns to light,
With every tear, I choose to ride.

(Chorus)
I’m chasing dreams, I won’t let go,
Through the storm, through the rain,
With every step, my heart will grow,
Finding joy, embracing pain.
