Title: "Labyrinth of Dreams"

(Verse 1)
In the maze where shadows creep,
We’ll wander through the night so long,
Though the paths may twist and steep,
In our hearts, we’ll find the song.

(Chorus)
Labyrinth of dreams we’ll roam,
In the echoes of the past,
Finding comfort, we are home,
In this journey, we hold steadfast.
