Title: "Guiding Stars"

(Verse 1)
When the night is dark and long,
We’ll find light in each other’s gaze,
With a song, we’ll right the wrong,
As our love will gently blaze.

(Chorus)
Guiding stars, we’ll light the way,
In the heavens, our hopes inspire,
With every night that turns to day,
We’ll rise as one through every fire.
