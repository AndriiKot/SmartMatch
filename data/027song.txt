Title: "Rhythms of Life"

(Verse 1)
Feel the pulse beneath the skin,
A symphony of joy, where we begin.
In the dance of seasons, we find our place,
Together we move with a timeless grace.

(Chorus)
In the rhythms of life, we’ll sway and spin,
With every heartbeat, let the journey begin.
No step too small, no dream too far,
In this beautiful dance, we’ll be the stars.
