Title: "Beyond the Shadows"

(Verse 1)
In the mist, where fears arise,
We’ll find courage hand in hand,
With every heartbeat, we’ll be wise,
Together, we will take a stand.

(Chorus)
Beyond the shadows, we will run,
Into the dawn with hearts so true,
In the warmth of morning sun,
We’ll build a world that’s meant for two.
