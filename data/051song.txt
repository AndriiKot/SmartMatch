Title: "Dancing on Clouds"

(Verse 1)
In the sky where dreams take flight,
We’ll soar on a gentle breeze,
With every heartbeat, day and night,
We’ll find our balance, feel at ease.

(Chorus)
We’ll be dancing on clouds of white,
Lost in laughter, we’ll cascade,
In each moment, pure delight,
Together, we’ll not be afraid.
