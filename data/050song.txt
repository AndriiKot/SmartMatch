Title: "Timeless Journey"

(Verse 1)
Through the years, our story's spun,
Each moment’s thread a masterpiece,
With every challenge, we have won,
In our hearts, we find release.

(Chorus)
This timeless journey we will roam,
With every step, we write our tale,
In love’s embrace, we’ve found our home,
Together, we will never fail.
