Title: "Canvas of Dreams"

(Verse 1)
Splash of colors on the page,
Life is art, we create,
Every brushstroke marks the stage,
In our hearts, we navigate.

(Chorus)
On this canvas of dreams, weâ€™ll soar,
Painting visions yet unseen,
With every heartbeat, we explore,
In this world, we are the dream.
