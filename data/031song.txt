Title: "Uncharted Paths"

(Verse 1)
In the wilderness, where few have been,
We’ll carve a journey, where dreams begin.
With every step, the unknown awaits,
Together we’ll embrace, navigate our fates.

(Chorus)
On uncharted paths, we’ll find our way,
With courage in our hearts, we’ll seize the day.
No fear of the future, we’ll write our fate,
A story of love, it’s never too late.
