Title: "Unbreakable"

(Verse 1)
When the shadows try to bind,
And the weight is hard to bear,
I’ll find the strength within my mind,
With each heartbeat, I declare.

(Chorus)
I’m unbreakable, I’ll stand tall,
Through the chaos, I will fight,
No matter how I stumble, fall,
I’ll rise up and claim my light.

(Verse 2)
The battles harden, but I grow,
Like a river carved in stone,
With every challenge that I know,
In this journey, I’m not alone.

(Chorus)
I’m unbreakable, I’ll stand tall,
Through the chaos, I will fight,
No matter how I stumble, fall,
I’ll rise up and claim my light.
