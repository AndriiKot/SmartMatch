Title: "Soul's Embrace"

(Verse 1)
In the quiet hours, our spirits blend,
An unbreakable bond, where hearts transcend.
With every heartbeat, a promise made,
In the depths of love, we’ll never fade.

(Chorus)
In the soul’s embrace, we find our home,
With every whisper, we’ll never roam.
Through all of time, our hearts will sing,
In this dance of life, we’ll take wing.
