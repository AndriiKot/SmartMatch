Title: "Waves of Time"

(Verse 1)
Underneath the ocean sky,
Waves are dancing, low and high,
Carrying memories like a song,
In this place where I belong.

(Chorus)
Waves of time, they come and go,
Tides of life, a gentle flow,
In the rhythm, I find my way,
Lost and found in every day.

(Verse 2)
Footprints fade upon the sand,
But the love will always stand,
Every moment, a fleeting glance,
In this ocean, I take a chance.

(Chorus)
Waves of time, they come and go,
Tides of life, a gentle flow,
In the rhythm, I find my way,
Lost and found in every day.
