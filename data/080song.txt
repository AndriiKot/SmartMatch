Title: "Radiant Hearts"

(Verse 1)
In the glow where love ignites,
We will shine through every tear,
With every day, our souls take flight,
Creating memories so dear.

(Chorus)
Radiant hearts will light the way,
In the darkness, love will beam,
With every moment, come what may,
Together, we will dream.
