Title: "Wings of Hope"

(Verse 1)
When the world feels heavy,
And the night begins to creep,
I spread my wings and ready,
To soar high and chase my leap.

(Chorus)
I’m flying high, I won’t fall down,
Through the clouds, above the ground,
With every breath, I wear my crown,
In the sky, my dreams are found.

(Verse 2)
Whispers of the morning breeze,
Call me forth to take my chance,
With every doubt, I find my ease,
Embracing life in this wild dance.

(Chorus)
I’m flying high, I won’t fall down,
Through the clouds, above the ground,
With every breath, I wear my crown,
In the sky, my dreams are found.
