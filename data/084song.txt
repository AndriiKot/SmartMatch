Title: "Invisible Ties"

(Verse 1)
In the silence, there’s a spark,
An energy we cannot see,
Binding us through all the dark,
In the depths, we’re truly free.

(Chorus)
Invisible ties that hold us tight,
In every heartbeat, we unite,
Through laughter and tears, shining bright,
Together, we are pure delight.
