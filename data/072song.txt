Title: "A World Apart"

(Verse 1)
Though the miles may keep us far,
In our hearts, you’re always near,
With every wish upon a star,
You’re the echo that I hear.

(Chorus)
In this world apart, we dream,
Finding solace in the night,
Connecting through the silent stream,
In our hearts, we’ll find the light.
