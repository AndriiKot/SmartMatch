Title: "Endless Horizon"

(Verse 1)
Across the waves, a journey begins,
A path uncharted, where freedom sings.
With every step, I feel alive,
Together we’ll soar, and we’ll survive.

(Chorus)
Towards the endless horizon, we’ll chase the light,
With hearts as our compass, we'll shine so bright.
No mountain too high, no ocean too wide,
Together forever, side by side.
