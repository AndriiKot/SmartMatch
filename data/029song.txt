Title: "Beneath the Stars"

(Verse 1)
Laying beneath the endless sky,
With dreams like constellations, we’ll fly high.
Every moment, a spark in the night,
With you by my side, everything feels right.

(Chorus)
Beneath the stars, we write our tale,
With the magic of love, we’ll never fail.
In the universe, where our hearts align,
Together forever, your hand in mine.
