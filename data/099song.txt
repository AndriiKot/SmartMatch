Title: "Threads of Destiny"

(Verse 1)
Fates are woven, hands entwined,
In the fabric of our days,
Every choice, a thread we've signed,
Guiding us through lifeâ€™s maze.

(Chorus)
Threads of destiny will weave,
Tales of heart and journeys far,
In this dance, we dare believe,
We are shining like the stars.
