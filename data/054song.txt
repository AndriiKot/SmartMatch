Title: "Illuminated Path"

(Verse 1)
As the dawn breaks through the night,
With each step, we’ll find our way,
Carrying hope, our guiding light,
In the dawn, we will not stray.

(Chorus)
On this illuminated path,
Every shadow fades away,
In the warmth of love’s sweet bath,
We’ll embrace the brand-new day.
