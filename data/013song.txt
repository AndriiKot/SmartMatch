Title: "Waves of Time"

(Verse 1)
Catch the rhythm of the tides,
Feel the ocean's gentle pull,
In the dance where memory hides,
Days unspoken, beautiful.

(Chorus)
We ride the waves of time, so free,
With every heartbeat, we will see,
That life’s a journey, not a race,
Embracing moments we can't replace.

(Verse 2)
Let the currents take you far,
To places where your dreams reside,
Underneath the guiding star,
In this adventure, we confide.

(Chorus)
We ride the waves of time, so free,
With every heartbeat, we will see,
That life’s a journey, not a race,
Embracing moments we can't replace.
