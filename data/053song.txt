Title: "Wings of Change"

(Verse 1)
With every choice, we spread our wings,
Venturing into the great unknown,
Embracing all that life will bring,
In this tempest, we have grown.

(Chorus)
We’ll fly on wings of change and grace,
Overcome the fears that hold us tight,
In this journey, we’ll find a place,
Where dreams ignite and hearts take flight.
