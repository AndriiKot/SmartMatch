Title: "Silent Waves"

(Verse 1)
A calm surrounds us, the world feels still,
In the depths of silence, our dreams fulfill.
Whispers of the ocean, secrets unfold,
In this moment, our stories are told.

(Chorus)
Silent waves, carry me away,
To horizons where our spirits play.
In the tranquility, I find my peace,
With every heartbeat, my worries cease.
