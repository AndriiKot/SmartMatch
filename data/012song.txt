"Moonlit Dance"

(Verse 1)
Underneath the silver glow,
In the night, our spirits flow,
With every step, our hearts will twine,
In this moment, you’re forever mine.

(Chorus)
Moonlit dance, come hold me tight,
In your arms, everything’s right,
With every spin, we’ll write our song,
In this love, we both belong.
