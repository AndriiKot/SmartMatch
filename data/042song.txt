Title: "Echoes of Tomorrow"

(Verse 1)
In the moments lost in time,
I’ll gather strength from history,
With every heartbeat, I will climb,
To write my own sweet mystery.

(Chorus)
I’m building dreams, I’ll pave the way,
With my voice, I’ll sing my tale,
Through the night, I won’t dismay,
With echoes bold, I will prevail.

(Verse 2)
The past may whisper, draw me back,
But I will march toward the sun,
With every step, I’ll stay on track,
Embracing all that I’ve become.

(Chorus)
I’m building dreams, I’ll pave the way,
With my voice, I’ll sing my tale,
Through the night, I won’t dismay,
With echoes bold, I will prevail.
