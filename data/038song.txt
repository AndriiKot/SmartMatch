Title: "Serenade of Light"

(Verse 1)
As the stars awaken, a serenade plays,
In the melody of night, our hearts shall blaze.
With every note, a promise we share,
In the symphony of life, there's magic in the air.

(Chorus)
Sing me a serenade of light,
With hopes and dreams, we'll take flight.
In the dance of shadows, weâ€™ll find our way,
Together forever, come what may.
