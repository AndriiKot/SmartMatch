Title: "Dancing Shadows"

(Verse 1)
In the twilight glow, shadows sway,
A dance of memories where we’ll play.
With every twirl, the laughter rings,
In this moment, freedom sings.

(Chorus)
Dancing shadows, let’s lose control,
With the rhythm of our hearts, we’ll feel whole.
In the gentle night, our spirits fly,
Together we’ll reach for the sky.
