Title: "Garden of Hope"

(Verse 1)
In the soil, seeds will be sown,
Fertile ground for our desires,
As the flowers bloom and groan,
We’ll nurture dreams and light the fires.

(Chorus)
In this garden of hope, we’ll grow,
Together through the rain and sun,
Through every trial, love will show,
In the end, we’ll be as one.
