Title: "Chasing Starlight"

(Verse 1)
Through the forest where dreams begin,
We’ll wander far, hand in hand,
In the night, where hope can spin,
Together, we will understand.

(Chorus)
Chasing starlight, we will glide,
In the darkness, love will shine,
With every wish, we’ll turn the tide,
In this journey, so divine.
