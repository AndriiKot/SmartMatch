Title: "Veils of Time"

(Verse 1)
A tapestry of nights and days,
Each moment stitched with care,
Through the threads, life softly plays,
In its beauty, we are bare.

(Chorus)
Veils of time will softly fall,
Lifting hearts to skies above,
In this journey, we hear the call,
To embrace our endless love.
