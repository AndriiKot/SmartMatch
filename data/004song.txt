"City Lights"

(Verse 1)
Neon dreams and distant calls,
In the city where magic falls,
Every heartbeat, every sigh,
In this moment, we touch the sky.

(Chorus)
City lights, they flicker and fade,
Chasing shadows that weâ€™ve made,
Lost in the heartbeat of the night,
Together, we'll make everything right.
