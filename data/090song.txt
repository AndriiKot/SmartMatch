Title: "Waves of Change"

(Verse 1)
In this ocean, tides will rise,
With every crash, a brand-new start,
As we navigate the skies,
We’ll carry hope within our heart.

(Chorus)
Waves of change will guide us through,
In the currents, we will thrive,
With every dream, we’ll start anew,
In our journey, we’re alive.
