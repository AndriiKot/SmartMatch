Title: "Fields of Gold"

(Verse 1)
In the fields of gold, we’ll find our way,
With the sun on our backs, we’ll seize the day.
Every moment rich, every dream unfolds,
In the treasure of living, our story is told.

(Chorus)
In fields of gold, we’ll dance and sway,
With laughter in the air, we’ll find the play.
Each heartbeat echoes, a melody sweet,
Together we’ll rise, never face defeat.
