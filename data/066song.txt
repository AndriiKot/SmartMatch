Title: "Echoes of Tomorrow"

(Verse 1)
In the moments that we share,
Time whispers softly in our ears,
With each laugh, we cast away despair,
Building futures, facing fears.

(Chorus)
Echoes of tomorrow call our name,
In the silence, dreams will play,
Through every challenge, we’ll proclaim,
Together, we’ll find our way.
