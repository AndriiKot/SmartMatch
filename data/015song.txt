Title: "Gentle Breeze"

(Verse 1)
Whispers flow like a gentle breeze,
Through the trees and the summer air,
In this moment, my spirit’s at ease,
Finding solace everywhere.

(Chorus)
Oh, gentle breeze, carry me high,
Above the clouds, where the sun won't hide,
With your touch, I feel so alive,
In this dance, my soul will thrive.

(Verse 2)
As the world slows down, I see,
The beauty in the small things fly,
With every rustle, I’m set free,
Together, we’ll soar through the sky.

(Chorus)
Oh, gentle breeze, carry me high,
Above the clouds, where the sun won't hide,
With your touch, I feel so alive,
In this dance, my soul will thrive.
