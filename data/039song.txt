Title: "Journey's End"

(Verse 1)
As the sun sets on the horizon wide,
With every step, we walk with pride.
Through trials faced and mountains climbed,
In the journey’s end, our love is primed.

(Chorus)
At journey’s end, we’ll find our peace,
With every heartbeat, our love won’t cease.
In the embrace of dusk, we’ll rest our heads,
Together forever, in love we’ll tread.
