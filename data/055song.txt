Title: "Unified Hearts"

(Verse 1)
In the rhythm of the crowd,
Voices blend, a sacred sound,
With our dreams, we stand so proud,
In connection, love is found.

(Chorus)
Unified hearts, weâ€™ll light the way,
Together, we are strong and bold,
In this moment, come what may,
With each other, we'll break the mold.
