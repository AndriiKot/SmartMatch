Title: "Silent Oceans"

(Verse 1)
In the quiet of the deep blue sea,
Secrets whispered on the wave,
With every tide, we will be free,
In the silence, we’ll be brave.

(Chorus)
Silent oceans, vast and wide,
Holding mysteries untold,
In the depths, we’ll learn to ride,
On the currents, hearts unfold.
