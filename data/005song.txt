"Chasing Stars"

(Verse 1)
Underneath the endless sky,
We’ll chase the stars, you and I,
In the silence, hear our dreams,
In this universe, nothing's as it seems.

(Chorus)
Chasing stars, we’ll break the night,
In the dark, we’ll find our light,
With every wish that we can make,
Together, we’ll never break.
