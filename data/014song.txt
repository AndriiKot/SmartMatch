Title: "Lost in Dreams"

(Verse 1)
In the quiet of the night,
I wander through my restless mind,
Searching for that one lost light,
A spark of hope that I can find.

(Chorus)
I’m lost in dreams, where shadows play,
Finding colors in shades of gray,
With every wish, I’m building skies,
A world where love will never die.

(Verse 2)
The echoes of my heart still call,
As I reach for what could be,
In this world, I won’t let fall,
The visions that inspire me.

(Chorus)
I’m lost in dreams, where shadows play,
Finding colors in shades of gray,
With every wish, I’m building skies,
A world where love will never die.
