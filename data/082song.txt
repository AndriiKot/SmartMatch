Title: "Garden of Wishes"

(Verse 1)
In the soil where dreams take root,
Planting hopes for all to see,
With every blossom, we’ll salute,
The beauty of our destiny.

(Chorus)
In this garden of wishes, we’ll grow,
Nurtured by the love we share,
Through seasons, we’ll find a glow,
Building dreams with utmost care.
