Title: "Whirlwind Moments"

(Verse 1)
Caught in the storm of time and chance,
Raindrops fall like whispered wishes,
In a whirlwind, we’ll find our dance,
Chasing dreams like fleeting fishes.

(Chorus)
Whirlwind moments spinning fast,
In every turn, we’re bold and bright,
Together, we’ll make memories last,
In this chaos, we’ll find our light.
