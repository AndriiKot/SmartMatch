Title: "A Million Stars"

(Verse 1)
Underneath a cosmic dome,
We’ll dance among the celestial light,
In every wish, a piece of home,
Guiding us through the night.

(Chorus)
A million stars to light our way,
In their glow, our dreams ignite,
With every heartbeat, come what may,
We’ll chase the sky, and take flight.
