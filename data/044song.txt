Title: "Heart of the Journey"

(Verse 1)
Every mile tells a story,
Of the dreams we hold so tight,
Through the struggles comes the glory,
Guiding us into the light.

(Chorus)
This is the heart of my journey,
With each chapter, I will grow,
Through the valleys, I will learn me,
In this life, I’ll steal the show.

(Verse 2)
Every heartbeat sings a tune,
As I dance through joy and pain,
Beneath the sun and under moon,
In every moment, I remain.

(Chorus)
This is the heart of my journey,
With each chapter, I will grow,
Through the valleys, I will learn me,
In this life, I’ll steal the show.
