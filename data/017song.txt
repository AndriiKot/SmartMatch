Title: "Starlit Dreams"

(Verse 1)
Underneath the velvet sky,
I make wishes on stars so bright,
With every heartbeat, I can fly,
In this magic, I find my light.

(Chorus)
Starlit dreams, they call my name,
Guiding me through the night’s sweet flame,
With every twinkle, I can see,
The world is full of possibility.

(Verse 2)
Every moment holds a chance,
To dance with shadows, chase the light,
In this universe, I’ll take my stance,
With every heartbeat, I’ll ignite.

(Chorus)
Starlit dreams, they call my name,
Guiding me through the night’s sweet flame,
With every twinkle, I can see,
The world is full of possibility.
