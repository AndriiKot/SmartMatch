Title: "Promises in the Rain"

(Verse 1)
When the skies begin to weep,
And the world is washed anew,
In the droplets, secrets keep,
Every promise made feels true.

(Chorus)
Promises in the rain we’ll share,
Cleansing hearts from all the pain,
With every storm, we’ll show we care,
In this love, we’ll always reign.
