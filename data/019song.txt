Title: "Infinite Skies"

(Verse 1)
As the sun begins to rise,
Painting gold ‘cross the morning blue,
I feel the warmth that never dies,
A canvas vast for me and you.

(Chorus)
Under infinite skies, we’ll soar,
Embracing dreams we've waited for,
With every heartbeat, we will fly,
No boundaries here, just you and I.

(Verse 2)
Through the storms, we’ll find our way,
With courage lighting up the night,
In this journey, come what may,
Together, we’ll ignite the light.

(Chorus)
Under infinite skies, we’ll soar,
Embracing dreams we've waited for,
With every heartbeat, we will fly,
No boundaries here, just you and I.
