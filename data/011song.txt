"Hearts in Flight"

(Verse 1)
With wings of love, we’ll soar so high,
Through the clouds, we’ll touch the sky,
Every heartbeat, a whispered dream,
Together, we’re a perfect team.

(Chorus)
Hearts in flight, we’ll never fall,
With you, I feel I can have it all,
In this journey, hand in hand,
Our love is a promise, forever we’ll stand.
